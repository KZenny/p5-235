    * Default constructor. 
    * @post The board is setup with the following restrictions:
    * 1) board is initialized to a 8x8 2D vector of ChessPiece pointers
    *      - ChessPiece derived classes are dynamically allocated and constructed as follows:
    *          - Pieces on the BOTTOM half of the board are set to have color "BLACK"
    *          - Pieces on the UPPER half of the board are set to have color "WHITE"
    *          - Their row & col members reflect their position on the board
    *          - All pawns on the BOTTOM half are flagged to be moving up.
    *          - All pawns on the BOTTOM half are flagged to be NOT moving up.
    *          - All other parameters are default initialized (this includes moving_up for non-Pawns!)
    *   
    *      - Pawns (P), Rooks(R), Bishops(B), Kings(K), Queens(Q), and Knights(N) are placed in the following format (ie. the standard setup for chess):
    *          
    *          7 | R N B K Q B N R
    *          6 | P P P P P P P P

    *          2 | * * * * * * * *
    *          1 | P P P P P P P P
    *          0 | R N B K Q B N R
